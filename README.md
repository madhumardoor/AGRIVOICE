# 🌾 Farmer Assistance System: Document Summarization & Speech Conversion  

This project helps farmers easily understand government schemes, loan subsidies, and benefits by **summarizing policy documents** and **converting them into speech** for accessibility. The tool extracts key information from official PDFs and provides an easy-to-understand summary, which can then be played as audio.
